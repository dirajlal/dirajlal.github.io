		<h2>My Project Description</h2>
		
	<ul> <!--unordered list-->
		<li>My aim in this project is to show election data and how it has changed overtime through visualizations. I then will use these data visualizations to tell a story about the history of which political party is in power during certain times. Through understanding what was happening in the country during certain election years, we can then better understand why one specific party performed better than the other in that year.</li> <!--href = a hyperlink reference-->
